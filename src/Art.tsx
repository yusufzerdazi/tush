              "Siblings" depicts the artist and their two older brothers. Throughout their life, they have been a crutch during each other's lowest points, and their support has never wavered.

            <p>by <b>Robin Mooneye (she/her) <a className="link" href="https://instagram.com/robin_mooneye">@robin_mooneye</a></b></p>
            <p>
            "Love on the Dancefloor" captures the magic of sharing a dance with another person, whether they are a partner, a lover, or someone just met. In that moment, the artist explores the deep connection that can form as two bodies move in harmony to the same rhythm.
            </p>
            <p>
            The dancefloor becomes a sacred space where souls intertwine, allowing vulnerability and joy to flourish through movement and shared energy.

            <p>by <b>Samuel McCracken (he/him) <a className="link" href="https://instagram.com/samuelmccrackenartworks">@samuelmccrackenartworks</a></b></p>
            <p>
            "My gender is a slutty Cowboy grandpa. I will not be elaborating further."
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by this quote by Queer.and.Feral, the artist embraces the playful spirit of a "slutty Cowboy grandpa" as a trans masculine identity. To add a touch of camp, the gun has been swapped for a banana- "because we all know slutty grandpas might also like a banana or two".

            <p>by <b>Kayleigh Hatch (she/her) <a className="link" href="https://instagram.com/kkayarts">@kkayarts</a></b></p>
            <p>
              Hatch's work explores the multifaceted experiences of womanhood, especially through bonding over shared traumas, joy, same-sex desire, community, and friendship.
            </p>
            <p>
            Her screenprints focus on feminine queer desire and self-acceptance, symbolizing liberation through authenticity. By distorting historical, mythological, and religious narratives to center queer relationships, she aims to make historical canons more accessible to queer people.
